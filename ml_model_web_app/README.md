# Job Role Classification Web App (Streamlit)

## 📌 Overview
This web application helps **job seekers** understand their job role in the context of AI adoption.  
By providing required information, the model classifies the role into one of three categories:
- **AI Adoption Role**-Jobs that currently require AI skills like AI Creation, Management or Advanced Use.
- **Automation Role** - Jobs that AI can automate in Future like repetitive, rules-based tasks.
- **Low AI Impact Role**- Jobs that are resistant to AI and Automation.


I have trained multiple ML models like Logistic Regression, SVM, Descision Tree, Random Forest,GaussianNB and MultinomialNB

Among all of these models Descision Tree perfomed well

This underlying model achieves **84% accuracy**, ensuring reliable classification results.

This app is one of the outcomes of the main project: [Main Project Repository](https://github.com/Sailikith-07/ai-impact-analysis-on-Indian-job-domains-python-powerbi).
